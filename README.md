# <Soothing Horizon>

I did this project because I was hired by a marketing agency that that met accessiblity standards. I found the scemantic HTML elements and made sure that the CSS selectors were condensed and organized to follow sematic structure. I learnt how and when to use the different HTML Scemantics to make the website easy to use.
